**Scope**
refers to what variables are available for use.  If the variable is declared globally, then that variable can be used anywhere in the application.  But if the variable is declared within a function, then that variable is private, and can only be used in that function block.

**Closure**
referes to an inner function having three scopes.  It has access to it's own variables, it's parent function's variables and also the global variables.  Closure is a way of making private variables.
