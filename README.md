# JavaScript Terminology
----
**Scope**
is the set of variables, objects and functions you have access to.  Variables declared within a function are local to that function and can only be accessed within that function.  Local variables are created when a function gets executed, and garbage collected once the function is completed.  A variable declared outside of a function is called a global variable and all functions have access to that variable.


**Closure**
referes to an inner function having three scopes.  It has access to it's own variables, it's parent function's variables and also the global variables.  The inner function can't call the parent function's arguments, but it can call the parent function's parameters directly.
